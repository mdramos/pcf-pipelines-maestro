# This file contains information about the "globs" parameter for each buildpack (when applicable)
# This is used in the buildpacks upgrade pipeline, to add to the corresponding pivnet resource,
# so only the specific file for the buildpack is downloaded.
# Example: the Java buildpack in pivnet returns two files: java_buildpack and java_buildpack_offline
#          For the offline buildpack, in order to download the correct file,
#          a globs config "*offline*" needs to be added to the "get" for the corresponding
#          resource entry in the buildpacks upgrade pipeline.
java_buildpack_offline: "*offline*"
java_buildpack: "*java-buildpack-v*"
tc_buildpack: "*tc-server-buildpack-v*"
